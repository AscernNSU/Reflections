When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  It's more preferable to use a remote repository if you are working on it with people that live in other city or 
even country, and also if you are working with it on more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It's for steady control of the repository's commits. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  Branches are used in local repositories only, it doesn't refer to GitHub. Clones allow to make copies of GitHub
repositories on local machines, and forks allow create repository from someone else's one on GitHub and work with
it without involving local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  Having such a copy would allow you to do fast-forward merges in future more easily.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

  It looks like version control makes collaborations easier, but it is important to understand
how Git and Github actually works.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
